## positioning stuff

`min-height: 100vh`

- gives the element a min height of 100% of the users viewport

## position attributes

1. Use position: relative when you need a positioning context for the child elements of a container.
2. Use position: absolute to position a child element with respect to its parent element.
3. A relatively positioned element can be nudged within its positioning context too.
4. If there are no parent elements with a positioning context, child elements will position themselves relative to the viewport.
